1. Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as instance variables- first
name, a last name and a monthly salary. Your class should have a constructor that initializes the
three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly
salary is not positive, set it to 0.0. Write a test application named EmployeeTest that demonstrates
class Employee's capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object's yearly salary.
Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee's yearly salary again.
